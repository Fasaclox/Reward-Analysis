Pillsbay Pharma utilizes the Quickbook application for daily transactions. In an effort to enhance sales and customer retention, the Quickbook reward program ensures that customers receive a 2% discount for every $10,000 purchase, which they can redeem on their next purchase.

The program was initiated in 2015, and the analysis provides a historical summary to date and a daily summary of reward activity.
